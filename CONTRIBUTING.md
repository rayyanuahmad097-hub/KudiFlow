# Contributing to KudiFlow

First off, thank you for your interest in contributing to KudiFlow 🚀
This project is actively evolving, and we welcome high-quality contributions that improve stability, scalability, and developer experience..

<!-- ## Stellar/Soroban Features - All Issues Implemented -->
## 🧭 Project Structure

This repository follows a **monorepo architecture**:

```
apps/
  api/        # Backend (NestJS)
  web/        # Frontend (React)

packages/
  ui/         # Shared UI components
  utils/      # Shared utilities
  types/      # Shared TypeScript types
```

---

## ⚠️ Core Rules (Non-Negotiable)

### 1. Separation of Concerns

* ❌ Do NOT mix frontend and backend code
* ❌ No `.tsx` files inside backend (`apps/api`)
* ❌ No backend logic inside frontend

### 2. Build Must Pass

* Every PR **must compile successfully**
* Run before submitting:

  ```bash
  pnpm install
  pnpm build
  ```

### 3. No Broken Imports

* ❌ Do NOT introduce unresolved imports
* ❌ Avoid invalid aliases like `@/...` unless properly configured
* ✅ Use relative paths or configured aliases only

### 4. No Incomplete Features

* ❌ Do NOT submit partially implemented modules
* ✅ If a feature is incomplete, isolate it or mark clearly

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Run apps

```bash
# Backend
pnpm --filter @kudiflow/api start:dev

# Frontend

```

### Build all

```bash
pnpm build
```

## 📦 Working with the Monorepo

### Add a dependency to a specific app

```bash
pnpm add <package> --filter web
pnpm add <package> --filter @kudiflow/api
```

### Add a shared package

```bash
packages/<your-package>/
```

## 🧪 Code Quality

### Linting & Formatting

* Follow ESLint and Prettier rules
* Keep code clean and readable

### Type Safety

* Use strict TypeScript practices
* Avoid `any` unless absolutely necessary
