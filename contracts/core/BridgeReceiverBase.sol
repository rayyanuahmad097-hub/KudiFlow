/// @title BridgeReceiverBase
/// @notice Base for cross-chain message receiver contracts. Integrates an
///         emergency circuit breaker so operations can be halted instantly if
///         an exploit is discovered in cross-chain messaging logic, without
///         redeploying contracts.
/// @dev Key entry points (`receiveMessage`, `withdrawLiquidity`) are gated with
///      `whenNotPaused` and delegate to internal hooks that concrete receivers
///      override. When paused, calls revert with OpenZeppelin's `EnforcedPause`.
///      `pause()` / `unpause()` are restricted to `GUARDIAN_ROLE` (intended for
///      a guardian key or Emergency Multi-Sig).
///
/// @dev EIP-712 domain spec (see docs/SIGNATURE_SPECIFICATION.md):
///      Concrete receivers overriding `_handleMessage` MUST verify the attestation
///      against the mandatory `KudiFlowDomain` separator before acting on a payload:
///
///        KudiFlowDomain(string name,string version,uint256 sourceChainId,
///                         uint256 targetChainId,address bridgeAddress)
///
///      `name = "KudiFlow"`, `version = "1"`, `sourceChainId` = EIP-155 ID of the
///      origin chain, `targetChainId` MUST equal `block.chainid`, and `bridgeAddress`
///      MUST equal `address(this)`. The OpenZeppelin `EIP712` base is NOT sufficient:
///      it cannot express `sourceChainId`, so the separator is built explicitly.
///
///      Note that `keccak256(message)` emitted by `MessageReceived` is a raw
///      calldata digest for indexing only — it is NOT the EIP-712 digest and MUST NOT
///      be used as the replay key. The replay key is the signed `messageId`.
